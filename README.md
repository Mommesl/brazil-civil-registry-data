# Brazil Civil Registry Data
Raw scrapings of https://transparencia.registrocivil.org.br/

The idea is that if we minimize the number of people scraping their website, everyone will benefit, so this repo will try to keep fine coarsed data as possible. Due to the design of their website extracting detailed information may be costly.

If you feel any data you need is missing, please open a issue here.

**Notice** This repo is just a copy of the data available at the site and isn't responsible for it, please read their documentation.
